# git_test

Hello Odin!


This is the first repository that I created on Git Hub using the command line.
I am currently reviewing the entire course and have revisited this lesson.
I thought I would update a few things in order to really flesh out each lesson and really
sear the information into my brain as I try to prepare to become a professional 
web developer.
